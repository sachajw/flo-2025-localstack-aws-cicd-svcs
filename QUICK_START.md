# ðŸš€ 2-MINUTE QUICK START

**Perfect for conference talks and demos!**

## Setup (30 seconds)

**You need:**
- Docker running (Docker Desktop)
- Python 3.8+ 
- 8GB+ RAM (LocalStack needs resources)

```bash
# Install Task runner (one-time)
python3 install-task.py
```

## Demo (90 seconds)
```bash
# Run complete demo - does everything!
task demo
```

**That's it!** This single command:
- âœ… Checks prerequisites
- âœ… Sets up LocalStack + all AWS services  
- âœ… Creates and uploads sample Node.js app
- âœ… Runs the complete CI/CD pipeline
- âœ… Shows published packages

**Everything is 100% local - no tokens, no internet after setup!**

## Individual Commands
```bash
task check      # Check prerequisites only
task setup      # Setup workshop only  
task monitor    # Monitor pipeline only
task packages   # Check packages only
task cleanup    # Clean everything up
```

## Fallback: Python Commands

If Task runner fails to install:

```bash
python3 setup_workshop.py       # Setup everything
python3 monitor_pipeline.py     # Watch pipeline  
python3 check_packages.py       # View results
python3 cleanup_workshop.py     # Clean up
```

## What This Demo Shows

1. **S3** - Stores source code locally
2. **CodePipeline** - Orchestrates the CI/CD workflow
3. **CodeBuild** - Runs tests and builds  
4. **CodeArtifact** - Hosts private npm packages
5. **Everything runs in LocalStack container on YOUR machine** - No AWS costs, truly local!

## Conference Talk Flow

1. **Show Setup** (30 seconds)
   ```bash
   task demo
   ```

2. **Watch Everything Happen** (90 seconds)
   - LocalStack starts
   - Sample app gets created and uploaded
   - Pipeline builds and tests the code
   - Package gets published to CodeArtifact

3. **Show Results** (30 seconds)
   ```bash
   task packages
   npm pack localstack-workshop-demo
   ```

**Total: 3 minutes + Q&A**

## Troubleshooting

**"Docker not running"**
â†’ Start Docker Desktop

**"Sample app not found"**  
â†’ Make sure you cloned the complete repo with `sample-app/` directory

**"Command not found"**  
â†’ Use `python3` instead of `python`

**"LocalStack failed"**  
â†’ `python3 cleanup_workshop.py --force && python3 setup_workshop.py`
